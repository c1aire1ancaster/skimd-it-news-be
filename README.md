## Developer Notes:

If you wished to clone this project and run locally:

You will need to create two .env files to connect to the two databases locally. Create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). 

Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
